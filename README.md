- Playfair.
- Hill cipher.
- Rail fence of depth level n.
- Columnar.
- Multiplicative inverse using Extended Euclid's.

Folder "Network" contains implementation for the following methods done over a network which means encryption is done on one machine "folder Holder" and decryption is done on another machine "folder client" :
